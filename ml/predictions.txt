Potential breakdown on day 3 due to Misc_Exhaust Gas Temparature: 228.6685028076172

Check the Sensor: Verify if the temperature sensor for the exhaust gas is functioning correctly. It might be faulty or miscalibrated, which could be giving inaccurate readings.

Inspect the Exhaust System: Ensure that there are no blockages or leaks in the exhaust system. Blockages can cause abnormal temperature readings.

Review Maintenance Records: Check if the machine has undergone regular maintenance. Ensure that all related components, such as the turbocharger and exhaust manifold, are in good condition.

Update Machine Learning Model: If you're using a machine learning model for predictions, consider updating or retraining the model with recent data to ensure it provides accurate predictions.

Check for Software Issues: Look into the software or algorithms that process the temperature data. There might be bugs or issues in how the data is interpreted or displayed.

Consult Documentation: Refer to the machine's technical documentation or contact the manufacturer for guidance on how to handle high exhaust gas temperatures.
